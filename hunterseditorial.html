    Social media is a great way for people to connect together and express themselves in ways they never could normally. People have the freedom to post nearly anything they want on most platforms, but some people prefer to disagree with this idea. Even more, some people feel the need to moderate what others do on social media. At Eden Prairie High School, Minnesota, students were disciplined for posting pictures on FaceBook in which they were shown drinking from red Solo cups. Why would they be suspended for something as simple as this, you ask? The answer is that the school decided to assume that the students were drinking alcoholic beverages, only because that is the primary purpose of red Solo cups.
	The school administration cannot assume what the students were drinking just based on the beverage container. According to The Associated Press, “Laurent tried to make his point by passing out red plastic cups that were similar to those seen in some of the photos. He noted that it was impossible to see what was inside the cups, so administrators couldn’t prove that students were drinking” (4). In a legal court of law, there must be adequate evidence against the convicted. This is the only evidence they have, so it is not enough to suspend the students.
	It’s not the school’s job to monitor students when they out of school. It’s the parents’/guardians’ job. They can decide if their teens are mature enough to drink alcohol out of school. Most parents would probably punish their teens anyways, just without suspending them from the school.
	One might argue that the school administration is doing what is right for their students, that they are helping them stay in school and stray away from making poor choices out of school. Ultimately, that is the parents’/guardians’ responsibility, not the school’s.
	To conclude, students shouldn’t get in trouble for something lacking enough evidence. Furthermore, the school shouldn't monitor their student’s outside activities. Don’t let schools control students when it is not necessary.
