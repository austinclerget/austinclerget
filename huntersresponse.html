    Dear Austin Clergent,
	I recently read your editorial about how the students at Eden Prairie High School deserved their punishment. I disagree. People have the right to post anything they want on social media and shouldn’t be punished in school for something they did out of school. Do you think the school had the right to take action against the students? What about the parents? I’m pretty sure they’ve already done their part in disciplining their teens, so I believe no further action is necessary. While I do agree with you when you said “It really does look like DUI citations are just a weak slap on the wrist for these young people”, but you cannot assume that all the teens drinking are also getting DUI’s. They’re more likely to make a smaller mistake which they will learn from instead of getting an entire DUI. When they happen to do something wrong other than a DUI, they can learn from that to be more cautious and smart when they decide to drink. Remember, you can’t assume that the teens were even drinking alcohol, as you do not have enough evidence for that. Because of all of this, I believe that your editorial can be taken the wrong way and some people will even take your side on this, which is absurd. I look forward to your rebuttal.

Sincerely,
Hunter Chopskie
