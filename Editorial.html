    At Eden Prairie High School, Minnesota, students protested over the administrator's decisions to discipline them for posting photos on FaceBook involving them drinking alcohol outside of school. According to The Associated Press, the school decided to intervene and punish the students by banning them from athletic activities for five weeks.(If they were of course: student athletes). “Laurent and other students said they knew of classmates who were banned from their sports teams for five weeks” (8).
The students’ argument was that the school administration was overreacting over the assumption that the students in the photos were drinking alcohol from red solo cups, despite the fact that it couldn’t be pointed out. “Laurent tried to make his point by passing out red plastic cups that were similar to those seen in some of the photos. He noted that it was impossible to see what was inside the cups, so administrators couldn’t prove that students were drinking” (4).
The administrators argument was the exact opposite: they assumed that if you’re drinking out of a red solo cup you’re instantly drinking alcohol and should be punished. “We do however, take action when we are given legitimate information about school, or Minnesota State High School sports league violations” (11). This said in response to the criticisms being voiced by (mostly) the student body.
To conclude, students were supposedly drinking out of red Solo cups and were disciplined. They retaliated by protesting against the school’s rules, which created a large issue, about regulations in the school involving the administration-- taking responsibility for their students outside of school.
