    Social Media is a great way for administrators to keep tabs on students outside their halls. Take the situation in Michigan circa 2008 as a prime example. Students...and almost more important, student athletes (who signed blatant "alchohol abstainment" contracts), were caught and hung out to dry...by their own cameras. I can see the headline now: "When Technology turns on You". These students were drinking and on social media, that's a way to bite yourself. If they didn't want to get caught they shouldn't have been posting... much less drinking. Underage drinking is a crisis that needs some serious reining in. To mant of our young children getting hurt in DUI related accidents, or making serious life-changing decisions all whilst under the influence. It really does look like DUI citations are just a weak slap on the wrist for these young people. It is high time we take action, have serious talks with your kids to set rules and boundaries. For the future generations: stop it now.
