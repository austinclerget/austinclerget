    Dear Hunter Chopskie,
	I recently read your editorial about how the students at Eden Prairie High School didn't deserve their punishment. I disagree.
  People have the right to post anything they want on social media, this is true. Yet shouldn’t they be punished in school for something they are strictly forbidden from doing by the school?.
  Do you think the school shouldn't have the right to take action against the students? What about the parents?
  I’m pretty sure they’ve already done their part in disciplining their teens, so I believe further action is necessary if they still fail to abide by simple rules.
  They’re more likely to make a bigger mistake which they still won't learn from instead of realizing their mistake without proper punishment.
  When they happen to do something wrong other than drink, they will think that if they can do  that then drinking is definetley no biggie.
  Remember, you can’t assume that the teens weren't drinking alcohol, as you do not have enough evidence for that.
  Because of all of this, I believe that your editorial can be taken the wrong way and some people will even take your side on this, which is absurd.
  I look forward to your rebuttal.


  Sincerely,
  Austin Clerget
